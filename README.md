# Bus_Reservation

Bus Reservation System :
In this approach, we'll create a simple console-based bus reservation system. Here's a basic outline of how you could structure the project:

1.Data Structures:
                 Create classes to represent the Bus, Passenger, and Reservation.
The Bus class could contain information about the bus's capacity and seat availability.
The Passenger class could store passenger information such as name and contact details.
The Reservation class could link a passenger to a specific seat on a bus.

2.Main Loop:
          Use a while loop to display a menu and accept user choices until the user decides to exit.

3.Menu Options:
              Implement menu options such as:
              a.Display available buses: Show a list of available buses and their seat availability.
              b.Make a reservation: Prompt the user to select a bus, choose a seat, and enter passenger information to make a reservation.
              c.Display reservations: Show a list of all reservations made.
              
4.Creating Reservations:
                       a.When making a reservation, prompt the user to select a bus, a seat, and enter passenger details.
                       b.Check seat availability before making a reservation.

5.Displaying Reservations:
                         Iterate through the list of reservations and display relevant information about each reservation.

6.User Input:
            Use a scanner or similar mechanism to get user input from the console.

This is a simplified example and doesn't cover all the details of a fully functional bus reservation system. In a real-world project, you'd need to handle edge cases, data persistence (e.g., storing reservations in a database), and possibly incorporate more advanced concepts and error handling.
